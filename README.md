## Features:
- Basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /)
- Calculation history display
- Light and Dark color themes
- Responsive design: maintains aspect ratio when resized
- Clear (C) and Clear Entry (CE) buttons
- Toggle sign (±) button

## Technologies Used:
- Python
- Tkinter (for GUI)

## How to Run:

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    * Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.
    * Tkinter is usually included with standard Python installations. If not, you might need to install it:
        * On Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install python3-tk`
        * On Fedora/RHEL: `sudo dnf install python3-tkinter`

2.  **Clone the Repository (or download the files):**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YourGitHubUsername/calculator-project.git](https://github.com/YourGitHubUsername/calculator-project.git)
    cd calculator-project
    ```
    (Replace `YourGitHubUsername` with your actual GitHub username)

3.  **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    python calculator_app.py
    ```
    (Or `python3 calculator_app.py` depending on your Python setup)

## Screenshots (Optional, but good to add later)
*Include screenshots of your calculator in both light and dark themes here.*
